            <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
              I'm a product designer based in India, currently working as a product designer at Razorpay. I work with the design systems team - setting up the foundations, building components, and setting up processes. Occasionally I work on interaction design - defining the motion system and building high fidelity prototypes. Over the past years, I have had the opportunity to work and learn from some awesome people at <span className="text-blue-400">UNDP</span>, <span className="text-blue-300">MakeMyTrip</span> & <span className="text-purple-400">Polygon</span>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
              Coming from a background in both engineering and design, I love connecting the dots between business goals, technical constraints and user satisfaction. The design journey that I started with the aim of making things look better changed me into a person who aims to create digital experiences that make life easier. I believe that the projects I have worked on have been the highlight of my design journey. I have been influenced to constantly look for problems around me and solutions to them; for challenges like these are what drive me to work relentlessly through sleepless nights for hours on end. And I love every moment of them.
            </p>

            <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
              Apart from that, I also play around with creative coding, interaction design, and motion design, working on side projects or just exploring something that I find interesting due to some reason.
